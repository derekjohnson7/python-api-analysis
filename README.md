Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. Using Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals, I was able to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would I prove that?

WeatherPy
In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator and computed the linear regression for each relationship based on hemisphere (using coordinates).

VacationPy
In this deliverable, I used my weather data skills to plan future vacations.
My main tasks was to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ my Python skills to create map visualizations.
